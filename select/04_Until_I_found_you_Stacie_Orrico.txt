I find it so unforgetable when a man knows how to treat a lady
Knows 'em from right, He's never shady

I find it so undeniable when a man's so so reliable (yeah yeah)
The way he outta be
The way he should be
Every night when I close my eyes
I lift my voice to the sky
I pray for this man, My man

I will be hoping for you
I will be searching for you
I will be watching for you
Until I find you, Find you
I will be patient for you
My eyes they won't ignore you
I know my heart will know you
When I find you, Find you

What, What

I find it so, so respectable when a man can take control
He's sentimental, And he's so gentle
I find it so, so wonderful when a man's so full of love
Not shallow, Someone I'm proud of
Every night when I close my eyes
I lift my voice to the sky
I pray for this man, My man

I will be hoping for you
I will be searching for you
I will be watching for you
Until I find you, Find you
I will be patient for you
My eyes they won't ignore you
I know my heart will know you
When I find you, Find you

And everytime I feel like settling
I know God's got you in mind for me
All I have to do is wait patiently
When I find you, find you

I pray for this man, My man
What
Yeah Yeah
They way he outta be, the way should be
I pray for this man, My man
Yeah, I like that
When I find you, find you

I will be hoping for you
I will be searching for you
I will be watching for you
Until I find you, Find you
I will be patient for you
My eyes they won't ignore you
I know my heart will know you
When I find you, Find you

Until I find you, Find you
When I find you, Find you
